# PyShell + PyLinux
Built from the ground up shell with PyLinux preinstalled.

PyLinux is very much inspired by Linux and uses the same Unix-like file system, minus the 'os' files like binaries n' stuff

v1.0.0 is codenamed vanilla and I might update it later

commands:

help
pwd
ls
cd
cat
whoami
lock
chname
chpass
chhost
clear
exit

With much silliness the PyLinux guy :3
